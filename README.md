3. Project Title:
Library Management System for University

4. Problem Statement (Why is this system needed?):
Many university libraries still manage books, borrowing, and returns manually or with outdated systems. This causes problems such as lost records, long queues, difficulty tracking available books, and inefficient management of library resources. The proposed Library Management System will automate book tracking, borrowing, returning, and reporting to improve efficiency and accuracy.

5. Project Objectives:
To develop a system that manages library books digitally;
To simplify the process of borrowing and returning books;
To reduce manual paperwork;
To provide accurate records of available and issued books;
To help library staff manage users and reports efficiently.

6. Scope of the System:
The system will:
Store book information (title, author, category, quantity);
Manage student and staff accounts;
Allow users to search for books;
Record borrowing and returning transactions;
Generate reports for the manager;
Track overdue books.
The system will not include online payment or external library integration!

7. Expected Users:
Student (Customer) – searches and borrows books;
Library Staff (Employee) – manages books and transactions;
Library Manager – views reports and controls the system.
