3. Project Title
- Library Management System for University
4. Problem Statement(Why is this system needed?)
- Many university libraries still use manual or outdated systems to manage books, borrowing, and returning processes. This leads to problems such as lost records, long queues, difficulty tracking available books, and inefficient library management.The Library Management System aims to automate library operations and provide an efficient, accurate, and user-friendly solution for both students and library staff.
5. Project Objectives
- To digitalize library book management  
- To simplify borrowing and returning processes  
- To reduce manual work and paperwork  
- To ensure accurate tracking of books and users  
- To generate reports for library management  
6. Scope of the System
The Library Management System will include the following functionalities:

- Managing book information (title, author, category, ISBN, availability)  
- Managing student and staff user accounts  
- Searching books by title, author, or category  
- Recording borrowing and returning transactions  
- Tracking due dates and overdue books  
- Generating reports for library managers  

The system will be used only within the university library.

### Out of Scope
- Online payment system  
- E-book reading functionality  
- Integration with external libraries 
7. Expected Users
- **Students** – search and borrow books  
- **Library Staff** – manage books and transactions  
- **Library Manager** – monitor reports and system performance
